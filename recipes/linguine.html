    <h1>Linguine alla Vongole</h1>
    <p>
        This is linguine alla vongole, which is clam spaghetti, but much more fun to say. With layers of clam flavor
        from clam juice, canned clams, and freshly steamed clams, and a rich, herbed wine sauce, this dish is something
        truly
        special.

        </li>
        <li>
            4 (6.5 ounce) cans chopped clams, drained, juice reserved
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon cornstarch, or as needed
        </li>
        <li>
            8 ounces linguine pasta
        </li>
        <li>
            12 fresh cherrystone or littleneck clams
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese, or as needed
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Step 1
        </li>
        <p>
            Pour a thin layer of olive oil into a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add onions and sauté until soft and
            fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and crushed red pepper, and sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
        </p>
        <li>
            Step 2
        </li>
        <p>
            Pour in white wine, bay leaves, parsley, oregano, thyme, black pepper, and salt. Increase heat to bring
            mixture to a simmer; cook until volume is reduced by half.
        </p>
        <li>
            Step 3
        </li>
        <p>
            Stir in bottled clam juice, plus clam juice from 3 cans of chopped clams (set chopped clams aside to use
            later in the recipe). Reduce heat to medium. Combine clam juice from remaining can of chopped clams with
            cornstarch in
            a small jar with a tight-fitting lid; place in the refrigerator to use later for thickening sauce.
        </p>
        <li>
            Step 4
        </li>
        <p>
            Simmer sauce over medium heat, stirring frequently, until it begins to have the consistency of a sauce,
            about 20 minutes.
        </p>
        <li>
            Step 5
        </li>
        <p>
            While sauce simmers, cook the pasta: bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a
            boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and set aside to keep warm.
        </p>
        <li>
            Step 6
        </li>
        <p>
            While pasta cooks, steam the clams: In a pot with a steamer rack, bring water to a boil. Steam whole clams
            over medium heat, covered, stirring or shaking the pot occasionally until they open, 5 to 7 minutes. Set
            aside.
        </p>
        <li>
            Step 7
        </li>
        <p>
            Now, pull it all together: add chopped canned clams to sauce; cook just until heated, about 3 minutes. If
            the sauce is still thin, shake the refrigerated clam juice-cornstarch slurry, and pour in a little at a
            time; cook and
            stir until just thick enough the starch from the linguine will also thicken the sauce a little.
        </p>
        <li>
            Step 8
        </li>
        <p>
            Toss linguine in the pan with clam sauce and coat evenly. Divide linguine onto individual plates; divide
            whole clams on top. Top with Parmesan cheese and fresh parsley.
        </p>
    </ul>
